# RadixSort
> I won't say that I worship "Radix", but I clearly respect "Him"

This repository is dedicated to radix sorting (LSD sorting). I will try to provide an optimized LSD sorting for uint64_t and float types (in C), for a more detailed study/immersion of the program, these programs will be duplicated in the assembler programming language (in particular NASM version 2.16.01 0x64).
